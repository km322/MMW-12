# MMW-12 Week 4 Notes:

## MMW-12 Lecture 7:
### Approaching Han Religion:
- Drawing a line around Han "religion" is difficult.
- Designating Core religious "areas"
  - Mythological thinking
  - Behaving well
  - Human and metaphysical hierarchies
  - Orthopraxy: rites and ceremony
  - Preparing for death

### Erasing the Religion/Philosophy Divide:
- "Schools" and "religion" tackle overlapping issues
  - Mythology, origins, cultural heroes
    - Three august kings and five emperors
  - How the universe works
    - Five phases/five elements
    - Yinyang
- Confucianism as a state "school of thought"
  - however, views on the moral lessons of the five emperors
  - emphasis on the "rites"

### The "God" Issue:
- Two key metaphysical entities
  - Shangdi
    - Supreme deity/emperor
    - Warring States Period outgrowth into the "five deities" (Wufang Shangdi)
  - Tian "Heaven" is it a force of God?

### Mediation:
- Importance of intermediaries:
  - Ancestors
    - Go-betweens for mortals reaching out to Tian and other "remote" religious entities
  - Living emperor
    - Representative of people in key rites
    - Mixes meaning of di ("thearch," "emperor," "divine")

### Rome: Percy Jackson Style
- Polytheism
  - Multiple gods with local affiliations
  - "Spheres" of influence
    - Commerce, the arts, wine and festivals, the home
- Anthropomorphism
  - Gods in human forms
  - Gods as emotional, interested in sex
  - Gods "born" with parents, but ageless.
 
### "Normative" Roman Religion
- Sacrifice and propitiation
  - Food, things, animals
- Ancestors
  - Dead emperors as gods who received worship
  - Remember "Julius Caesar" divinization
- Prayers
  - Verbal prayers to gods
  - "Occasional" prayers for healing, rescue, thanksgiving.
