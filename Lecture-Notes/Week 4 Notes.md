# MMW-12 Week 4 Notes:

## MMW-12 Lecture 7:
### Approaching Han Religion:

  - Mythological thinking
  - Behaving well
  - Human and metaphysical hierarchies
  - Orthopraxy: rites and ceremony
  - Preparing for death

### Erasing the Religion/Philosophy Divide:
- "Schools" and "religion" tackle overlapping issues
  - Mythology, origins, cultural heroes
    - Three august kings and five emperors
  - How the universe works
    - Five phases/five elements
    - Yinyang
- Confucianism as a state "school of thought"
  - however, views on the moral lessons of the five emperors
  - emphasis on the "rites"

### The "God" Issue:
- Two key metaphysical entities
  - Shangdi
    - Supreme deity/emperor
    - Warring States Period outgrowth into the "five deities" (Wufang Shangdi)
  - Tian "Heaven" is it a force of God?

### Mediation:
- Importance of intermediaries:
  - Ancestors
    - Go-betweens for mortals reaching out to Tian and other "remote" religious entities
  - Living emperor
    - Representative of people in key rites
    - Mixes meaning of di ("thearch," "emperor," "divine")

### Rome: Percy Jackson Style
- Polytheism
  - Multiple gods with local affiliations
  - "Spheres" of influence
    - Commerce, the arts, wine nd festival, the home
- Anthropomorphism
  - Gods in human forms
  - Gods as emotional, interested in sex
  - Gods "born" with parents, but ageless.
