### MMW-12 Lecture 6

#### The Ancient Economy in Comparative Perspective:

##### What is Economic History?:
- Labor:
  - Wage vs. Slave (and lots of in-between)
- Production:
  -  Control of materials, labor, and capital
- Capital and wealth:
  - Value
  - Money and Price
- Trade, exchange, distribution:
  - Markeys
  - Transportation and trade
- Political economy:
  - States vs. individual economic actors
 
##### The Political View of the Two Hans:
- Western Han:
  - Strong centralization and consolidation rule
  - Debt to Legalist force on agricultural and military
  - Heavy tax extraction for military
- Eastern Han:
  - Decentralization and weak emperors
  - Growth of large and unchecked landholders
    - Control over the increasingly impoverished peasantry
    - Decline of social mobility
  - Weak tax extraction

##### The Rural Economy: ⤵️
- The Hamlet:
  - 100 families of small landholders.
  - Building block and ideological core of Han society.
  - A site of contact between the local and the state.
  - Fundamentally disrupted by the great estates
- Land Ownership:
  - Both private and state-controlled lands
  - State lands either cultivated by state-owned slaves or leased to peasants.

##### The Merchant/Farmer Preadox: 🧑‍🌾
- Compulsory payment in money forced farmers to take high-interest loans from local merchants to pay taxes, increasing effective tax burdens.
- Wealthy merchants register as landowners to avoid taxes.
- "At Present merchants are rich and honored although they are humbled by the law; farmers are poor and lowly although they are respected by the law." - Han Shu 24a, p.1133.

##### The Industrial Economies: 🤓
- The public/private tension:
  - Centralization/Decentralization tug-of-war extends to the manufacture and sale of core industries.
- The industrial economy:
  - salt
  - iron
- The luxury economy:
  - Imperial workshops make luxury goods like mirrors and vessels.
  - Also site of manufacture for weapons and other essential goods.

##### Background on the Discourse Salt and Iron: 😥
- Two interrelated problems:
  1. Wars impoverished the state
  2. Private manufacturers and merchants lead to price fluctuation and price gouging for essential goods.
- Proposed state monopoly on the sale of iron and salt (and, briefly, liquor).

##### Discourse on Salt and Iron: 🧂
1. The monopolies created under Emperor Wu continued after his death
2. The next regent, Huo Guang, feels increasing pressure from elite families who resent the monopoly.
3. He calls a summit of scholars who fall into two groups:
   - Reformists: suggest a dialing back of state intervention in the economy.
   - Modernists: defend the state monopolies.

##### Like Han, like Rome
- Core Similarities:
  - State revenues streams:
    - Olive oil industry and imperial estates
    - State control (by not monopoly) of mines
  - Price controls:
    - Securing the grain supply for Rome
  - International trade:
    - Large-scale, long-distance trade for luxury goods
  - Infrastructure:
    - Support for inter-city and inter-province movement of goods. 

##### Ancient Corporations:
- The Public/Private Partnership:
  - Corporations (Rome) vs. Bureaucracy (Han)
  - The "government contract" executed by public contractors (_societas publicanorum_)
  - Private companies help:
    1. Collect taxes
    2. Supply the army
    3. Mine minerals
    4. Rebuild temples and public buildings

##### Welfare Economics:
- Bread and circuses:
  - Price regulations of grain to reduce price-gouging in famine
  - 200,000 tons of wheat per year for Rome alone
- Philanthropy and its discontents:
  - Elite competitions and splashy philanthropy:
    - Sponsorship of public works
    - Risk of "style over substance"
- The "Guild"
  - Grey area of business and government
  - Key for emperor's control of Rome.
