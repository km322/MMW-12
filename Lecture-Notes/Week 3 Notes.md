#### The Ancient Economy in Comparative Perspective:

##### What is Economic History?:
- Labor:
  - Wage vs. Slave (and lots of in-between)
- Production:
  -  Control of materials, labor, and capital
- Capital and wealth:
  - Value
  - Money and Price
- Trade, exchange, distribution:
  - Markeys
  - Transportation and trade
- Political economy:
  - States vs. individual economic actors
 
##### The Political View of the Two Hans:
- Western Han:
  - Strong centralization and consolidation rule
  - Debt to Legalist force on agricultural and military
  - Heavy tax extraction for military
- Eastern Han:
  - Decentralization and weak emperors
  - Growth of large and unchecked landholders
    - Control over the increasingly impoverished peasantry
    - Decline of social mobility
  - Weak tax extraction

##### The Rural Economy:
- The Hamlet:
  - 100 families of small landholders.
  - Building block and ideological core of Han society.
  - A site of contact between the local and the state.
  - Fundamentally disrupted by the great estates
- Land Ownership:
  - Both private and state-controlled lands
  - State lands either cultivated by state-owned slaves or leased to peasants.

##### The Merchant/Farmer Preadox:
- Compulsory payment in money forced farmers to take high-interest loans from local merchants to pay taxes, increasing effective tax burdens.
- Wealthy merchants register as landowners to avoid taxes.
- "At Present merchants are rich and honored although they are humbled by the law; farmers are poor and lowly although they are respected by the law." - Han Shu 24a, p.1133.

##### The Industrial Economies:
- The public/private tension:
  - Centralization/Decentralization tug-of-war extends to the manufacture and sale of core industries.
- The industrial economy:
  - salt
  - iron
- The luxury economy:
  - Imperial workshops make luxury goods like mirrors and vessels.
  - Also site of manufacture for weapons and other essential goods.
