### MMW-12 Lecture 6

#### The Ancient Economy in Comparative Perspective:

##### What is Economic History?:
- Labor:
  - Wage vs. Slave (and lots of in-between)
- Production:
  -  Control of materials, labor, and capital
- Capital and wealth:
  - Value
  - Money and Price
- Trade, exchange, distribution:
  - Markeys
  - Transportation and trade
- Political economy:
  - States vs. individual economic actors
 
##### The Political View of the Two Hans:
- Western Han:
  - Strong centralization and consolidation rule
  - Debt to Legalist force on agricultural and military
  - Heavy tax extraction for military
- Eastern Han:
  - Decentralization and weak emperors
  - Growth of large and unchecked landholders
    - Control over the increasingly impoverished peasantry
    - Decline of social mobility
  - Weak tax extraction

##### The Rural Economy: ‚§µÔ∏è
- The Hamlet:
  - 100 families of small landholders.
  - Building block and ideological core of Han society.
  - A site of contact between the local and the state.
  - Fundamentally disrupted by the great estates
- Land Ownership:
  - Both private and state-controlled lands
  - State lands either cultivated by state-owned slaves or leased to peasants.

##### The Merchant/Farmer Preadox: üßë‚Äçüåæ
- Compulsory payment in money forced farmers to take high-interest loans from local merchants to pay taxes, increasing effective tax burdens.
- Wealthy merchants register as landowners to avoid taxes.
- "At Present merchants are rich and honored although they are humbled by the law; farmers are poor and lowly although they are respected by the law." - Han Shu 24a, p.1133.

##### The Industrial Economies: ü§ì
- The public/private tension:
  - Centralization/Decentralization tug-of-war extends to the manufacture and sale of core industries.
- The industrial economy:
  - salt
  - iron
- The luxury economy:
  - Imperial workshops make luxury goods like mirrors and vessels.
  - Also site of manufacture for weapons and other essential goods.

##### Background on the Discourse Salt and Iron: üò•
- Two interrelated problems:
  1. Wars impoverished the state
  2. Private manufacturers and merchants lead to price fluctuation and price gouging for essential goods.
- Proposed state monopoly on the sale of iron and salt (and, briefly, liquor).

##### Discourse on Salt and Iron: üßÇ
1. The monopolies created under Emperor Wu continued after his death
2. The next regent, Huo Guang, feels increasing pressure from elite families who resent the monopoly.
3. He calls a summit of scholars who fall into two groups:
   - Reformists: suggest a dialing back of state intervention in the economy.
   - Modernists: defend the state monopolies.

##### Like Han, like Rome
- Core Similarities:
  - State revenues streams:
    - Olive oil industry and imperial estates
    - State control (by not monopoly) of mines
  - Price controls:
    - Securing the grain supply for Rome
  - International trade:
    - Large-scale, long-distance trade for luxury goods
  - Infrastructure:
    - Support for inter-city and inter-province movement of goods. 

##### Ancient Corporations:
- The Public/Private Partnership:
  - Corporations (Rome) vs. Bureaucracy (Han)
  - The "government contract" executed by public contractors (_societas publicanorum_)
  - Private companies help:
    1. Collect taxes
    2. Supply the army
    3. Mine minerals
    4. Rebuild temples and public buildings

##### Welfare Economics:
- Bread and circuses:
  - Price regulations of grain to reduce price-gouging in famine
  - 200,000 tons of wheat per year for Rome alone
- Philanthropy and its discontents:
  - Elite competitions and splashy philanthropy:
    - Sponsorship of public works
    - Risk of "style over substance"
- The "Guild"
  - Grey area of business and government
  - Key for emperor's control of Rome.
