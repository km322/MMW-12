  - Markeys
  - Transportation and trade
- Political economy:
  - States vs. individual economic actors
 
##### The Political View of the Two Hans:
- Western Han:
  - Strong centralization and consolidation rule
  - Debt to Legalist force on agricultural and military
  - Heavy tax extraction for military
- Eastern Han:
  - Decentralization and weak emperors
  - Growth of large and unchecked landholders
    - Control over the increasingly impoverished peasantry
    - Decline of social mobility
  - Weak tax extraction

##### The Rural Economy:
- The Hamlet:
  - 100 families of small landholders.
  - Building block and ideological core of Han society.
  - A site of contact between the local and the state.
  - Fundamentally disrupted by the great estates
- Land Ownership:
  - Both private and state-controlled lands
  - State lands either cultivated by state-owned slaves or leased to peasants.
