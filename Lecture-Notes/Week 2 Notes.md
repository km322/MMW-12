### MMW-12 Lecture 3 Notes

Citizenship - originally just for the Romans, key for voting, going to court, running for office, and entering contracts

Magistrates - Two consuls at the top who run things

Roman generals - consul of someone else given imperium(absolute power) by the senate to fight wars. Those given imperium are called imperator

Assemblies - The Senate passes laws and oversees international relations, the Assembly of Plebs gains the right to pass laws bringing on the plebs, then everybody.
Tensions between representative (senate) and direct (Pleb assembly)  forms of government

#### Fundamental flaws of the Republic:

Land for the Citizen Soldier: Armies were made up of Roman citizens and their allies, they would not be paid during military campaigns.

Latifundia: Rome conquers a large portion of Italy. However, most land is distributed unevenly favored towards the elites, resulting in less land for everyone else.

Land distribution is pursued by the tribunes of the plebs, unpopular among the senate. End up being declared outlaws and are murdered by the senators

Professionalizing the army: Due to an increasing percentage of the army not being able to afford to be a citizen soldier, Marius enrolls soldiers regardless of their property qualifications. He promises them income from the wars themselves, signifying the beginning of the process of creating a professional army

Soldiers' loyalty lies to the generals rather than the senate. When civil war breaks out. Marius and Caesar can count on troops whose loyalty has been bought 

Gaming Roman Politics: Roman elites would bend rules for glory, and distinct political groups were formed within elites where the groups would make it harder for other elites to pass laws. Consuls like Caesar would go to drastic lengths to get what they wanted.


Four Perspectives on the Civil War
Ganeus Pompey Magnus - Commander under Sulla, favored the senate. Due to his service to Sulla, Pompey becomes a consul.

Pompey secures commands through new laws bending the rules. Gains imperium over all oceans and coasts to deal with Mediterranean pirates. 

The Senate has a group called Optimates, often made from old families. 
Optimates oppose Populares

Marcus Tullius Cicero is a staunch Optimate and helps Pompey gain power. 

Julius Caesar wants to become glorious and gain power by fighting more wars.
